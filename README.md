## 3. Environment Setup
To set up the Next.js application with MongoDB Atlas and the Next.js server, follow these steps:

A. Install Node.js:

1. Mac users: Download the .pkg file for Node.js v20.5.0 from [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.5.0/).
   
   Windows users: Download the MSI or .exe file for Node.js v20.5.0 from [here](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v20.5.0/).

2. After installing Node.js, ensure it is installed correctly by running `node -v` in the command prompt or terminal. The version should be 20.5.x.

B. Install Git and Windows-Build-Tools (Windows PC Only):

1. Download and install the latest version of Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

2. Run PowerShell as administrator and execute `npm install -g windows-build-tools`.

C. Install Yarn:

npm install -g yarn

D. Set Up Environment Variables and Configuration:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your Next.js application.

2. Configure the following variables in the `.env` file:
MONGODB_URI=<Your MongoDB Atlas connection string>

Replace `<Your MongoDB Atlas connection string>` with your actual MongoDB Atlas connection string.

For the Next.js server configuration, refer to the official Next.js documentation [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#production).

Now you're ready to start developing your Next.js application with MongoDB Atlas!
